<h1 class="karnataka" id="state">About Karnataka</h1>
<p class="para2">Karnataka is a state in the southwestern region of India, bordered by Goa, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, with a long coastline along the Arabian Sea. It is known for its diverse landscapes—from the Western Ghats’ forests and waterfalls to the Deccan Plateau’s dry plains. Bengaluru (Bangalore) is the state capital and India’s major technology hub, home to startups, research institutions, and global IT companies. The official language is Kannada, and the state celebrates a rich literary and performing arts tradition, including Yakshagana and Carnatic music. Karnataka has a deep historical legacy with UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as Hampi (Vijayanagara Empire) and Pattadakal (Chalukyan temples). Other notable heritage cities include Mysuru, known for its royal palace and Dasara festival, and Belur–Halebidu for exquisite Hoysala temple architecture. The state’s economy spans information technology, biotechnology, aerospace, agriculture (coffee, spices, silk), and tourism. Coorg (Kodagu) is famed for coffee estates and misty hills; coastal towns like Mangaluru, Udupi, and Gokarna offer beaches and unique cuisine; wildlife sanctuaries such as Bandipur and Nagarahole protect tigers and elephants. Karnataka’s cuisine varies by region—bisi bele bath, ragi mudde, neer dosa, Mysore pak, and Udupi dishes are popular. The state’s festivals, handicrafts (Mysore silk, sandalwood, Channapatna toys), and classical as well as folk traditions reflect a vibrant cultural identity.</p>
